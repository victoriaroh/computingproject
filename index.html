    <div class='py-3 my-4'></div>

    <h2>Project Topic Choice and Exploration Questions</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-9">
        <p>Motivation for Choosing Thie Topic: The primary motivation for this project was to explore the intricate relationship between various socio-economic and geographical factors of countries and their Olympic performances. By understanding these relationships, we can gain insights into how different elements might influence a nation's success in the Olympics.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-9">
        <p>Reason for Choosing This Topic: The intersection between sports performance and socio-economic/geographical factors is a fascinating area of study that has not been extensively explored in popular media. This topic offers a unique perspective on the Olympics, going beyond just the sports statistics and delving into how a country's characteristics might influence its athletes' performances.

    <h2>Data Source Description and Data-to-Information Transformation</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-9">
        <p>The data sources mentioned above were extensive and detailed. The transformation from data to information involved several key steps: <br><br>
Data Cleaning and Preparation: This involved handling missing values, ensuring consistent data formats, and merging datasets based on common columns like country names.<br>
Data Analysis and Aggregation: We conducted various analyses, such as grouping data by country and calculating aggregate metrics like total medals won, average rank positions, and categorizing data into bins or quartiles for better visualization.<br>
Visualization: By employing different types of visualizations (scatter plots, bar plots, box plots, line plots, and histograms), we transformed raw data into insightful information that reveals patterns and relationships between different variables and Olympic performance.<br>
Each step in this process was crucial in converting raw data into meaningful information that could be easily interpreted and understood by the target audience, ultimately fulfilling the project's objective to explore the factors influencing Olympic success.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

<h2>Challenges of the Project</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-9">
        <p>The most challenging aspect of the Olympic data analysis project was undoubtedly the data cleaning and merging process. Here's why: <br><br>
Data Inconsistency: The datasets from different sources often had inconsistencies in how countries were named or coded. Aligning them correctly to ensure accurate merging required meticulous attention.<br>
Handling Missing or Incomplete Data: Both datasets contained missing or incomplete entries. Deciding how to handle these (whether to fill in missing values, drop them, or find alternate sources) was a complex task that required careful consideration to avoid skewing the results.<br>
Complexity of Data: The datasets were extensive and rich with various types of data. Extracting the relevant information and transforming it into a format suitable for analysis while maintaining data integrity was a significant challenge.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

<h2>Rewarding Aspects of the Project</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-9">
        <p>The most rewarding aspect of this project was the ability to derive meaningful insights and narratives from complex datasets. Specifically:<br><br>
Discovery of Patterns and Trends: Unveiling potential correlations between socio-economic/geographical factors and Olympic performance was deeply satisfying. These insights could provide valuable perspectives for sports analysts, policymakers, and the general public.<br>
Visualization Impact: Seeing the raw, complex data transformed into clear, understandable, and visually appealing charts and graphs was highly gratifying. It made the data accessible to a broader audience, not just those with a technical background.<br>
Potential for Real-World Impact: The project's findings could have implications in sports science, policy-making, and even education, providing a sense of contributing to broader societal understanding and development.</p>

<h1>Visualizations and Insights</h1>
    <div class='py-3 my-4'></div>

   <h2>Correlation Heatmap</h2>
    <div class="row justify-content-center">
      <img src="heatmap.png" width="700" class="img-fluid mx-auto border-0 rounded-0">
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-9">
        <p>This heatmap shows the correlation of our key Olympics performance metric, "Average Rank" and "Total Medals" with the socioeconomic metrics including GDP, unemployment rate, etc. 
        Through this visualization, we hoped to get an overview of which socioeconomic metrics are related to olympics performance of a country. Here were some of the socioeconomic metrics highly correlated with olympics performance: <br><br>
        Average Rank (note that lower means higher ranking): Positively correlated with birth rate and CPI. Negatively correlated with life expectancy<br>
        Total Medals: Positively correlated with land area, CO2 emissions, GDP, life expectancy. Negatively correlated with % of agricultural land, out of pocket health expenditure, birth rate<br><br>
        Based on these findings, we decided to dig deeper into metrics with high correlation with olympics performance. </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Total Medals vs GDP Scatterplot</h2>
    <div class="row justify-content-center">
      <img src="Total Medals vs GDP.png" width="1000" class="img-fluid mx-auto border-0 rounded-0">
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-9">
        <p>This scatter plot with regression line shows the relationship between number of total medals and GDP of a country. Log transformation was used to illustrate the relationship more clearly. This visualization further shows that there is a positive correlation between number of medals and GDP, as there the regression displays a positive slope. This is an interesting insight because it points at the importance of financial resources when it comes to the performance of atheletes in the olympics. Having a higher GDP means that there is a greater financial capacity for the country to support athelete's training, equipments, etc. and this directly reflects in their performance. </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Total Medals vs Land Area / % of Agricultural Land</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-9">
        <img src="Total Medals vs Land Area.png" width="500" class="img-fluid mx-auto border-0 rounded-0">
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-9">
        <img src="Total Medals vs % Agricultural Land.png" width="500" class="img-fluid mx-auto border-0 rounded-0">
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-9">
        <p>These two graphs are scatterplots that show the correlation of total medals with land area / % of agricultural land. These two charts show a very interesting insight because it suggests that while countries with higher land area tend to perform better, countries with high percentage of agricultural land perform worse. It is particularly interesting that percentage of agricultural land drops exponentially for countries with the highest medal count. These visualizations show that while having a high land area may be helpful, it is not as significant as being an industrial economy. Athletes from countries with an agrarian economy are less likely to perform well than those from industrialized economies. Furthermore, this trend is especially prominent for countries with a very industrialized economy.</p>
